You are given an array with N values (1 <= N <= 10^5) and K paint buckets of K distinct colors (2 <= K <= 10^3), where each element a_i satisfies the condition 1 <= a_i <= K.

You want to paint a segment of a wall with N evenly spaced color blocks following the array, with a_1 being the left-most block on the wall and a_N being the right-most block of the wall.

You can perform two operations, changing the paint color you use, and painting a contiguous segment of unpainted wall with the paint color you are using. You can paint anywhere on the wall that hasn't already been painted. Changing the paint color has a cost of 10, and painting a segment has a cost of 1.

Output the minimum cost of painting the wall with the pattern in the array, followed by the lexographically smallest working solution to paint the wall.

output notes:
output can be of arbitrary length
each command is a line
0 - paint, params b_i (block of wall to start on) l_i (nonzero amount of segments to paint rightwards)
1 - change color, params c_i (the paint color)
